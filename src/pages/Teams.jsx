                    <h3>For Less than 8 Team Members: Join a Public Course</h3>
                    <p>As a team, you’ll develop your UX Metrics plan as a team . and alongside a small group of teams facing similar challenges. Together, you’ll start drafting the blueprints for what change will look like across your organization. You’ll come away with your own custom approach to UX Metrics that your entire team can use.</p>
                    <p>When you sign up for a public course cohort:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sign up each team member at the Team Member Price and save $100 off each registration.
                        </li>
                        <li>Each team member purchases their registration separately or contact us for an invoice.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Pick the next cohort that works best for your team members.
                        If you need to move your team to another cohort date after your team signs up, no worries; we can take care of moving your team.
